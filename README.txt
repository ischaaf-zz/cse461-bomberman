Looks like MonoGame is already included in the project so no need to install it, just clone the Repo

cloning:

clone the repo to a local folder
add repo to visual studio under source control
commit changes locally (within VS)
for pushing to gitlab you have to use the command line (git bash the folder with the project: git push)
